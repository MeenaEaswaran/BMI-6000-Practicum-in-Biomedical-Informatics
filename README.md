# BMI 6000: Practicum in Biomedical Informatics

This repository documents a **bioinformatics project** for the BMI 6000: Practicum in Biomedical Informatics course. The project, titled **"Single-cell analysis of the laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and healthy adjacent tissue "**, aimed to characterize the cellular heterogeneity and regulatory landscape of LSCC at a single-cell resolution. Utilizing single-cell transcriptomic methodologies in R programming language and public datsets, the study identified alterations in cellular composition, gene regulatory networks, and intracellular communication that differentiate carcinoma in situ LSCC from neighboring healthy epithelial tissue.
